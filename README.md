Sure, here are some tips for web app pentesting:

1. Understand the web application architecture: Before starting the web app pentesting, it's important to understand the architecture of the web application. It will help you to identify the potential vulnerabilities in the web app.

2. Map the attack surface: Identify all the entry points to the web app. It includes URLs, APIs, and any other methods that can be used to interact with the application.

3. Identify the technologies used: Knowing the technologies used by the web app can help you to find the vulnerabilities in those technologies.

4. Check for authentication and authorization: Check the authentication and authorization mechanisms used in the web app. Identify any weak passwords, default passwords, or insecure storage of credentials.

5. Test for input validation: Test for input validation to identify any injection vulnerabilities such as SQL injection or Cross-site scripting.

6. Test for access control: Check if the access control mechanisms implemented in the web app are working correctly. Make sure that the user can only access the resources that they are authorized to access.

7. Test for session management: Test the session management mechanism to identify any session-related vulnerabilities.

8. Test for error handling: Check the error handling mechanism implemented in the web app. Identify any error messages that can be used by attackers to gain information about the system.

9. Test for file uploads: Check the file upload functionality to identify any vulnerabilities that can be exploited by attackers to upload malicious files.

10. Keep up-to-date with the latest security trends and vulnerabilities: Keep yourself updated with the latest security trends and vulnerabilities in web applications.

Note- Remember that these tips are not exhaustive, and there are many other things that you should consider when conducting a web app pentest. It's also important to follow a systematic approach and to document your findings carefully.
